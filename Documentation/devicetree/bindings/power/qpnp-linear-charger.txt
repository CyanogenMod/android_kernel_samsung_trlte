Qualcomm QPNP Linear Charger

The charger module supports the linear battery charger peripherals on
Qualcomm PMIC chips.

There are four different peripherals in the charger module.
Each of these peripherals are implemented as subnodes.

- qcom,chgr:		Supports charging control and status reporting
- qcom,usb-chgpth:	USB charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.

Sub node required structure:
- A qcom,charger node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
	the spmi-dev-container property. Each subnode reflects
	a hardware peripheral which adds a unique set of features
	to the collective charging device. For example USB detection
	and the battery interface are each seperate peripherals and
	each should be their own subnode.

Sub node required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,qpnp-linear-charger".
- reg:			Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the peripheral.
- interrupt-names:	Specifies the interrupt names for the peripheral. Every
			available interrupt needs to have an associated name
			with it to indentify its purpose.

			The following lists each subnode and their corresponding
			required interrupt names:

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid

			The following interrupts are available:

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid:		Indicates valid USB connection.
			 - coarse-det-usb:	Coarse detect interrupt triggers
						at low voltage on USB_IN.
			 - chg-gone:		Triggers on VCHG line.
			 - overtemp:		Triggers on over temperature condition

			 qcom,chgr:
			 - chg-done:		Triggers on charge completion.
			 - chg-failed:		Notifies of charge failures.
			 - fast-chg-on:		Notifies of fast charging.
			 - vbat-det-lo:		Triggers on vbat-det-lo
						voltage.

Example:
	pm8916-chg: qcom,charger {
		spmi-dev-container;
		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-linear-charger";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		qcom,chgr@1000 {
			reg = <0x1000 0x100>;
		};
		qcom,usb-chgpth@1300 {
			reg = <0x1300 0x100>;
			interrupts = <0 0x13 0x1>,
			interrupt-names = "usbin-valid",
		};
	};
